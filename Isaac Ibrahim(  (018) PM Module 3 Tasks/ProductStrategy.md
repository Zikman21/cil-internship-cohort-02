### Qa):  What is a digital  product you currently use everyday, why and how would you improve its features?
The Digital product I currently use every day is Canva. 

#### Why do I use Canva? 
Canva offers a variety of features due to which it has gained popularity among millions of  people including me. I use Canva because of the following benefits I enjoy
- Free Design Platform 
Canva is free to use and open for everyone. You can use it for creating compelling  designs for social media, marketing campaigns, or projects. There are few features  in Canva that are useful for professionals.  
- No skills or experience required 
You don't need any prior experience as a graphic designer to use Canva. With a  variety of tools and layouts available, you can swap between fonts and images to  create a professional design. 
- Ease of use with multiple templates, and fonts 
Canva has a library of different backgrounds, templates, images, fonts, stickers to  ensure that you get the best results. You don't have to be a techie to use these  features. 
- Endless possibilities 
Canva has every digital design possibility covered from Facebook and Pinterest  posts to e−book covers, Infographics, and Resume. You can also make GIFs,  animations, videos It also has an option for you to create custom designs. 
- User−friendly interface 
The layout of Canva is easy to use. On the left side are the grids for templates,  photos, stickers, and background. Above the design are tabs for fonts, color  palettes, and other formatting tools. With the drag and drop feature, you can use  these tools in your design in a few clicks. 
- Creating a team 
You can create your team on Canva so that they can have access to the designs.  You can determine the kind of access your team members or employees have through  the shareable links to make edits. 

#### How do I improve its features?
Although Canva offers great features and a user-friendly interface, it does not support  offline design. This can be very annoying especially when you need to come up with a  design quickly and the network signal is not being friendly.
Hence, allowing users to design offline is how I would improve the already amazing features offered by Canva.

### Qb): What is your strategic vision in the above Scenario?
My strategic vision in the above scenario would be to build a Canva that allows everyone in the world to design both online and offline.
Canva’s Vision is to empower everyone in the world to  design,  However it failed to recognize that poor internet networks confront some parts of the world especially in Africa. It is important we recognize that poor internet networks are inevitable problems to internet users in Africa, and as such the platform should therefore allow users to equally continue their designs even Offline and not just online. By doing this, Canva will have an edge over some of its biggest competitors like Visme, Adobe Spark, Crello, Design Wizard, among others. And truly empower everyone in the world to design.
