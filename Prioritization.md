### Task:  Chose a framework youâ€™d use for the product selected in the last topic.
For the **Visual/Image Search** product, I will select the Value vs. Complexity Quadrant. My reason for selecting this framework is because it seeks to answer the following question:
- Will this feature push our goals and metrics forward if we build it?
- Can we feasibly build it with the resources we have?

In the case of my Visual Search feature, the table below illustrates how Value vs. Comlexity Quadrant applies.

| **How important it is (Value)** | **How difficult it is (Complexity Quandrant)** |
| --------------------            | ----------------------                         |
| **Value**                       | **Cost**                                       |
  - Potential revenue              
| **Benefits**                    | **Effort**                                     |
  - To customers                    - Development effort
  - To potential customers          - Operational
                                    - Implementation effort
| **Impact**                      | **Risk**                                       |
  - On the business goals             
  - On the strategic goals
