### Task:  Describe a preferred product (existing or novice) and how youâ€™d determine market opportunities

The product I will be describing here is a visual (image) search feature I believe every e-commerce platform in Nigeria shoud add to there set of features.

#### What is Visual or Image search?
Visual or Image search is an upgrade from the traditional text-based search feature on e-commerce stores.
With visual search, all an online shopper needs to do is take a picture of the product they are interested in and upload it to the platform. The platform automatically processes the image for results. Unlike the traditional text-based search, in visual search, there is no need to figure out the best keyword for it, the exact phrase or the best description so that search results are satisfcatory. You can literally find the right match within seconds.

#### How I would Determine market opportunities for this product
In determining the market opportunities for visual search feature, I will use the following structures;
- Target Market Study
- Competition analysis
- User experience
- Potential Profit

#### Target Market Study:
The target market for the visual search product is the ecommerce industry in nigeria. And the current e-commerce spedning in Nigeria is estimated at $12 billion, and is projected to reach $75 billion in revenue per annum by 2025 (www. trade.gov). Equally, reports by statistics. Com shows that the number of online shoppers in 2021 was 78 million.
What these numbers mean therefore is that the ecommerce industry in Nigeria is huge and will only continue to grow. Hence, online marketpalces with unique features will stand a greater chance of making more from the above numbers. 

#### Competition Analysis
According to a report by statista.com,  the number of online marketplaces in Nigeria is 58. However, none of this online marketplaces have a visual/image search added to their search features.
Thus introducing visual/image search will not be facing any competition as all major players in the industry are yet to inculde this feature to there set of features. This is likely going to be a goldmine if implemented properly.

#### User Experience
In an industry like the e-commerce, great products and great prices are not enough. User experience when navigating the platform is very essential especially, in attracting and retaining users. For instance, a customer visit an online store to search for a product, after typing the name or phrase of the product, result is displayed with like 20pages. Meaning if what the user is looking for is not in page 1 he/she should go to page 2 and so on. This will be very exhausting and might actually make a user loose interest. Probably the user really needed that product but after scrolling over 2 or 3 pages he/she decides that this maynot be available or he/she does not have that kind of time to go through all the pages, meanwhile the searched product might be located on the page 15 or so.

#### Profit Potential:
From the user experience instance given above, you see that a bad user experience means loss of profits for the site visited. Having a visual/image search will enhances users purchase, which means more money to the platform. Having a visual seacrch feature will not only bring you customers, it will retain and bring returning customers. Because people are happy with how your sites work they are likely to always use it whenever they need to buy something
